# 15_math_problems_with_unittest

This project contains 15 small Python programs solving classic math problems, each accompanied by a corresponding **unit test** using Python's `unittest` framework.

### Included Programs

- Find the largest of two numbers
- Calculate the simple interest
- Calculate the compound interest
- Find the prime numbers in a given interval
- Calculate the area of a circle
- Find the n-th Fibonacci number
- Check if a number is a Fibonacci number or not
- Calculate the sum of the squares of the first *n* natural numbers
- Calculate the sum of the cubes of the first *n* natural numbers
- Calculate the sum of the elements of an array
- Calculate the sum of divisors of a given number
- Check if a triangle is possible with given angles
- Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first *n* natural numbers
- Calculate the volume of a cylinder
- Find the sum of odd factors of a given number

### Project Structure

Each program is in its own `.py` file, and each has a dedicated test file named `test_<program_name>.py`.

These tests validate that each function behaves as expected with known input/output pairs, emphasizing **correctness** and **basic test coverage**.

> This project helped me sharpen my math logic and test design skills by crafting small, self-contained programs and building meaningful test cases for each.
